# Practical multi AI agents and advanced use cases with crew AI

Join our new short course, __Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI__, taught by João Moura, Founder of CrewAI, and learn how to build and deploy agent-based apps for advanced real applications in the industry.

In this course, you will build several practical apps like an automated project planning system, lead-scoring and engagement automation, support data analysis, and content creation at scale.

Throughout this course, you’ll learn: 
* The main building blocks—tasks, agents, crews—that go into creating these multi-agent systems, and all the different things that make them work such as caching, memory, and guardrails.
* How to integrate your multi-agent application with internal and external systems.
* How to connect multiple agents in complex setups including parallel, sequential, and hybrid, and how to create flows that involve multiple crews working together.
* How to test your crew by measuring key metrics and train it using human feedback to optimize its performance for better and more consistent results.
* How to work with multiple LLMs in your multi-agent system, using the appropriate model sizes and providers to fit each agent’s specific task.
* How to start a project from scratch in your environment, and prepare it for deployment.
* __Bonus Interview with Jacob Wilson, the Commercial GenAI CTO at PWC__: Learn about deploying agentic workflows in real industry use cases.

### Use cases in the course

You will work on many exciting use cases such as building:
* A crew for automated project planning, breaking a project into tasks, creating time estimates, and allocating resources to them.
* A project progress report with an example of interacting with a project management system such as Trello.
* An agentic sales pipeline that takes in lead information, enriches and scores it, and writes personalized emails for qualified leads.
* A customer support data insights analysis pipeline that generates issue reports and visualizations.
* Content creation crew that researches the web, uses RAG as a tool on specific web pages to write content, reviews and modifies the content for quality, and generates social copies for different platforms.

## What you'll learn

* Build agents that collaborate in complex workflows, integrating external tools and using different models to handle specific tasks efficiently.
* Learn to evaluate and enhance your agents by conducting performance tests and providing human feedback to train and optimize their performance.
* Create multi-agent systems to automate tasks, such as project planning, lead scoring, data reporting, and large-scale content creation.

## Who should join?

Anyone who has basic Python knowledge and wants to build complex and practical multi-agentic systems.
